# Traffic signs classifier
In this project we're going to build and train deep neural network to classify 43 classes of traffic signs using [German Traffic signs](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset)
. Detected classes will affect the behavioral planning of self driving car.
